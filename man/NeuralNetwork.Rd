\title{Create a NeuralNetwork for further visualization}
\usage{
NeuralNetwork(f, data, layers, scale = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A formula representing the model that should be fitted. Handles
categorical, binary and numerical data.}

\item{data}{The data that should be used for training the neural network.}

\item{layers}{Vector representing the number of layers that should be used.}

\item{scale}{Boolean representing if the data should be scaled or not}

\item{...}{further parameters for neuralnet, see:
\code{\link[neuralnet]{neuralnet}}}
}
\value{
NeuralNetwork class containing the neuralnet, type of dependent
  variable, name of dependent variable, set layers and the additional
  parameters provided.
}
\description{
\code{NeuralNetwork} Returns the trained neural network
}
\details{
This is a S3 class. It defines a neural network and has the
plot_partial_dependencies method for plotting marginal effects.

# Example: Numeric or Binary
